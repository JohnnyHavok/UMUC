To build and run the amazonrest sample you must first sign up as a 
amazon web service developer at aws.amazon.com.  When you sign up you
will be given an access key.  You must also generate a secret key. You 
must change the ACCESSKEY and SECRETKEY variables
in the AccountRestClient.java file to your access key and secret key.

After you have signed up do the following:


Steps in building the sample:

1) Create a directory called amazonrestservice in your home directory.  
2) Copy this directory and its subdirectories to the amazonrestservice 
   directory that you just created.  This means that  
   in the amazonrestservice directory that you created you should see 
   the following files:

   howtobuild.txt
   the directory /import
   the directory /product
   the directory /resource

   under the /resource directory you should see searchitems.xsl
   under the /import directory you should see commons-codec-1.4.jar
   under the /product directory you should see /com and build.xml
   under the /com directory you should see /cmis445
   under the /cmis445 directory you should see /amazonrestclient and
         xslttransform
   under the /amazonrestclient you should see AmazonRestClient.java and SignedRequestsHelper.java
   under the /xslttransform you should see XSLTTransform.java

3) Change back to the accountrestclient directory that you just
   created and then to the product directory. Run the ant buildall task in
   the build.xml file:
    ant 

Steps in running the sample
   
1) Run the ant startamazonrestclient task in the build.xml
   file:
    ant startamazonrestclient
