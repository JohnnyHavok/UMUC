To build the all java version of the account sample you
must have the JAVA jdk 1.3 installed on your
system.

Steps in building the sample:

1) Create a directory called account
2) Copy the following files into the directory:
   a) account.idl
   b) AccountClient.java
   c) AccountServer.java
3) Run the idl compiler against the idl file:
    idlj -oldImplBase -Fall account.idl
   The -Fall option tells the idl compiler to create
   both the client and server stub and marshalling
   components.
4) Compiler the server:
   a) Go to the account directory.
   b) enter javac AccountServer.java AccountModule/*.java
5) Compiler the client:
   a) Go to the account directory.
   b) enter javac AccountClient.java AccountModule/*.java

Steps in running the program:
   a) Run the server - 
        java AccountServer & 
   b) Run the client - 
        java AccountClient
